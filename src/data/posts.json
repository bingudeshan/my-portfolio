        "content": "Newton's Second Law of Motion states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of that object times its acceleration. \n\nFormula: **F = ma**\n\nWhere:\n- **F** is the net force applied\n- **m** is the mass of the object\n- **a** is the acceleration\n\nThis fundamental principle explains how the velocity of an object changes when it is subjected to an external force.",

        "content": "Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where a pair of particles interact in such a way that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently of the state of the other.\n\nAlbert Einstein famously referred to this as 'spooky action at a distance'.",
